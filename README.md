# Applied-Econometrics

## Advanced Applied Econometrics (PhD) - 44825
## This was a PhD-level econometrics course that I took in the second year of my MA in Economics at Sharif University of Technology. Here, I will share the course syllabus along with all the problem sets and my answers. My code for this class is written in STATA, though we were also permitted to use other programming languages such as R and Python.
### The two main textbooks of this course were as follows: 
### 1. Angrist, J. D. and Pischke, J. S. (2009). Mostly harmless econometrics: An empiricistâ€™s companion. Princeton University Press.
### 2. Cunningham, S. (2021). Causal Inference. Yale University Press.
