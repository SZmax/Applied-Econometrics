# Applied-Econometrics

## Advanced Applied Econometrics (PhD) - 44825
## This was a PhD level econometrics course that I took as a second year student of my MA in Economics at Sharif University of Technology, over here I will share the syllabus of this course and all the problem sets I did for completing this course. My codes for this class are all in STATA but in this course we were allowed to used other coding programs like R and Python as well.
### The two main textbooks of this course were as follows: 
### 1. Angrist, J. D. and Pischke, J. S. (2009). Mostly harmless econometrics: An empiricistâ€™s companion. Princeton University Press.
### 2. Cunningham, S. (2021). Causal Inference. Yale University Press.
